                        Great news!  If you don't like having your custom site hosted at www.contractorcopilot.com, you can instead
                        have it hosted on your own custom domain.  The content will stay the same and the control panel will still be
                        here, it will just be easier for your customers to remember your website address and look more professional.
                    </p>
        
                    <h3>Wait, what's a domain name?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A domain name is simply the first part of a web address.  For example, our domain name is contractorcopilot.com.
                        If you'd like you can have your custom site available at YourURL.com instead of contractorcopilot.com/c/YourURL.

                    <h3>What do I need to do?</h3>

                        Just send a domain request below.  We'll be in contact within 24 hours to provide you with a payment link and
                        confirm your domain.  You'll have your site set up within two days!
