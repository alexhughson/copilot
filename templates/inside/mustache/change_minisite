                    We're more than happy to host your site for free.  Your site 
                    is more than just a basic 'who-am-i' type page - it provides
                    scheduling options, is localized to where you do business, and 
                    allows you to take credit card and debit card payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, your site is hosted at <strong>contractorcopilot.com/c/YourBusinessHere</strong>.
                    The <strong>YourBusinessHere</strong> can be switched to whatever
                    you like, but it needs to be unique.  Unfortunately, if you're
                    running 'Bobs Lawncare', there might be another 'Bobs Lawncare'
                    in another city and they may have taken 'BobsLawncare' already.
                    If you're running into issues, try something like LawncareInToronto,
                    or TorontoBobsLawncare.

                                    You'll find that Contractor Copilot is about 
                                    selling a specific service or skill, if you 
                                    want to sell 5 or 6 different things it might be 
                                    better to talk to a customer in person about that.

                                    not want to talk about price during that first
                                    paragraph unless you just have one main service
                                    and want to highlight it right away.

                                    what you can do with a bit of a sales pitch, but

                                general repair.  I can gurantee you a 24 hour

                                with a quote.  If you approve it, I'll purchase
                                the hardware and install it and add the cost to

			    <h3>Pictures</h3>
			    <p>
	    		    If you'd like, you can suplement your site with a couple pictures.
    			    These are completely optional.
			    </p>
			    <p>
	    		    As part of our terms of service, you must own the rights to the
	    		    pictures you're uploading.  If you're not sure if you do or not, just
	    		    make sure it was you that took the picture and don't just post a
	    		    picture you found on Google Image search.

    	    		        This picture will be used in the "Who I Am" section.  People
	        		        are more likely to trust in your business if they can attach
	        		        a face to the company.  Aim for a picture that suits your 
	        		        business (offering legal advice should probably be a bit
	        		        more formal than offering to cut someones grass).

    			            This picture will be used in the "What I Do" section.  If you
	    		            sell a product, put your picture here.  If you have a company
	    		            it may be a good call to put that here instead.  If you're offering
	    		            a service, a picture of you performing that service would be 
	    		            pretty fitting.

                    Your minisite comes with a payment form where your customers can pay you via credit card instead
                    of cash.  This process is simple to use, just direct them to your website and tell them to pay
                    you under the 'pay' tab.

                    third party payment processor AlertPay.  Once the payment is submit you will receive an email
                    with the customers information and payment details.
