                We've made it really easy for you to publish your business.  Publishing is the process of getting your
                business name out there.  By being listed in business directories people will be more likely to find 
                you and will make your custom site show up higher in web searches.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll do all the leg work for you.  Just tell us a bit about your business and we'll take care of the
                registration forms, the confirmation emails, and the rest of the dirty stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you submit, we'll get back to you within 24 hours with a payment link and confirmation.  Most directories
                will be updated instantly, however some may take 48 hours or more to list.  We'll make sure the listings
                are posted and respond back to you with links.

                            Some publication options offer to take a description of your company.  Most ask for a minimum
                            of 250 characters (a paragraph or two).

                            The Yellow Pages requires your company to be officially registered with the government.  If
                            you are registered then you can verify your business by entering that number.  Contractor
                            Copilot does not use this number for anything other than communicating it to Yellow Pages
                            to ensure you are listed.
